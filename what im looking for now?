# Building an E-commerce Website for Pentesting Practice

This repository documents my journey in building a full-stack e-commerce website from scratch. My goal is to gain a deep understanding of web development principles within the context of an online store. This project will involve implementing features like user authentication, product catalogs, shopping carts, and payment processing.

Understanding the complexities of an e-commerce platform is crucial for penetration testing. I aim to learn how these features work to better identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.

**Key Objectives:**

* Build a functional e-commerce website with core features.
* Gain practical experience with e-commerce development technologies.
* Develop a strong understanding of e-commerce application architecture.
* Apply this knowledge to improve my penetration testing skills, specifically in e-commerce security.
