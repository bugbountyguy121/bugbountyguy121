# Cybersecurity Basics: 12-Hour Hacking Course Exploration

This repository documents my journey through a 12-hour introductory hacking course. My goal is to grasp the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, providing a foundation for future exploration and experimentation.

**Project Motivation:**

This course is designed to introduce me to the core principles of cybersecurity. By learning the basics, I aim to create a playground for safe and ethical experimentation, allowing me to understand how these concepts work in practice.

**Course Scope:**

The 12-hour course covers:

* **Networking Fundamentals:** Basic network concepts and protocols.
* **Linux Command Line:** Essential Linux commands for cybersecurity.
* **Web Application Basics:** Introduction to web vulnerabilities.
* **Basic Security Tools:** Overview of common security tools.
* **Ethical Hacking Concepts:** Introduction to ethical hacking methodologies.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* **Understanding of Cybersecurity Basics:** Grasping core concepts and terminology.
* **Familiarity with Basic Security Tools:** Learning how to use common security tools.
* **Linux Command Line Proficiency:** Developing basic command-line skills.
* **Web vulnerability Awareness:** Understanding how basic web vulnerabilities work.
* **Learning Documentation:** Maintaining a record of my learning and course exercises.
* **Basic Hacking "Playground":** Setting up a safe environment to explore the tools and techniques.

**Learning Approach:**

This repository will contain notes, code snippets, and exercises from the course. I'll document my learning process, focusing on understanding the "why" behind each concept and tool.

**Future Considerations:**

After completing the course, I plan to use this foundation to build a safe environment for practicing and experimenting with the learned techniques. This will involve setting up virtual machines and exploring basic penetration testing tools.
